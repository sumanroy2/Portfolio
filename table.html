				<h1>Do you know to Agriculture of Bangladesh?</h1>
				 <p>Agriculture is the important for Bangladesh . Because, Bangladesh is most dependen on Agriculture to develope.<br><br>

				 <u><strong>Wheat:</strong></u>
				 <!-- <img src="wheat.jpg"><img src="wheat2.jpg"> -->
				Wheat cereal plant of the genus Triticum, especially, T. aestivum, of the family Graminae. The grain constitutes a major food item and an important commodity on the world grain market. Wheat is one of the first of the grains domesticated by human.
				<span id="dots"></span>
				<span id="more"> Bread wheat is known to have been grown in the Nile Valley by 5000 BC and it is believed that the Mediterranean region was the centre of domestication. The civilization of West Asia and of the European peoples have been largely based on wheat, while rice has been more important in the East Asia. Since agriculture began, wheat has been the chief source of bread for Europe and the Middle East. It was introduced into Mexico by the Spaniards in the early part of 16th century and into Virginia, USA by English colonists early in the 17th century. Although it is one of the oldest of the cereal crops, it was introduced in Bengal in 1930-31. Its importance as a food crop was recognised around 1942-43. The plants bear this edible grain in dense spikes. The culm of the mature wheat plant is a hollow, jointed cylinder that comprises 3-6 nodes and internodes.<br><br>


				Wheat field
				The wheat leaf consists of the sheath, blade, ligules and auricle. The leaf sheaths normally enclose the lower 2/3 of culm. A maximum of 5-7 seminal roots may function throughout the life of the wheat plant. Until now the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute has developed 16 varieties of wheat. Sonalika, the variety released in 1973, remained dominant through the 1980s. Kanchan, developed in 1983 and made available to growers in 1987, now covers more than 80 percent of the wheat area.

 				<u><strong>Paddy:</strong></u>
 				<!-- 	<img src="paddy.jpg"><img src="farmer.jpg">
 				--> 	The labour shortage created by the current shutdown is worrying farmers ahead of the Boro paddy harvest, despite different measures taken by the government to ensure maximum crop yield.
				<br><br>
				Although the agricultural ministry is making special arrangements for transportation of labourers from different districts to the country's granaries, labour leaders are unwilling to leave home fearing coronavirus infection.
				Even the ministry's sanctioning of Tk 110 crore to help farmers buy harvester machines at a subsidy might do little to ease the crisis as small and marginalised rice producers, especially in the haor region, cannot afford such investments.

				Harvest of Boro paddy, the principal crop of the country, starts in the haor region in a week, in the Chalanbeel area of the north in two weeks and in other parts of the country in May, agriculturists and farmers say.
